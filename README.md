# Evaluation of Coffee Chain Analysis Script

This script creates a dataset for a hypothetical coffee chain with five locations. It generates scatter plots showing the relationship between different variables, uses the OpenAI API to generate a natural-language analysis of the locations' sales data, and compiles the scatter plots and the analysis into a PDF report and a PowerPoint presentation.

This is a small scale representation of what what it would look like to use python in combonation with gpt to create reports for high level execs.  The goal is to create this to interperate larger data sets and save time for analysts.

## Running the Script

1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python your_script.py`
